On the second step, the user will be shown a list of available flights according to the destination user has entered before. The list contains flight serial number, flight timings, and ticket price(per person) and the user will be able to choose any one flight using the flight serial number mention in the list.

As this project is operated by the user's end, the number of passengers enter initially will be considered as a family/cluster and will be provided by a unique booking code after selecting a desired flight serial number.
